This project is a comprehensive ticket booking system for an event named Halloween Haunt, which incorporates various security measures based on user authorization levels. The application utilizes Spring Boot framework and Thymeleaf template engine for the front-end, 
while Spring Security handles the authentication and authorization based on user roles. The database employed in the system is MySQL. The system provides users with a user-friendly interface to book tickets for the event after providing necessary details such as age, gender, student status, pets preference, and ticket type selection. The system allows venders (admin) to add, view, edit, and delete tickets while guests (users who register with guest authorization) can only purchase their own tickets. Additionally, venders have access to records and reports on ticket sales that are not available to guests. The system also provides an interface for administrators to manage the status of each ticket. The application is fully functional and secure, providing an efficient way to manage ticket sales for Halloween Haunt.
